abstract: "Temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence, photosynthetic\
  \ active radiation, and turbidity data collected from 2012 to present by the Hakai\
  \ Institute in waters surrounding Calvert Island, Johnstone Strait, and Quadra Island\
  \ areas. This dataset presents data collected by oceanographic profiler instruments\
  \ (RBR XR-620, RBR Concerto, RBR Maestro, and Seabird SBE 19plus v2) which have\
  \ been automatically processed by following respective manufacturer's guidelines\
  \ (see Hakai Water Properties Profile Processing and QA/QC Procedure Manual). \n\
  \nThe provisional processed data are then quality controlled by applying a series\
  \ of tests that are following the QARTOD standards and more tests specific to the\
  \ Hakai Institute data (see Hakai Water Properties Profile Processing and QA/QC\
  \ Procedure Manual).  \n\nThe research dataset provides a subset of the provisional\
  \ dataset which has been manually reviewed and judged good for science quality level.\n\
  \nData were collected by the Hakai Institute Oceanography Program, the Nearshore\
  \ Program, and the Juvenile Salmon Program."
