abstract: "This dataset is comprised of sea surface temperature data collected using\
  \ HOBO TidbiT MX Temperature 400' data loggers (MX2203) deployed at nine locations\
  \ in False Creek, British Columbia. Loggers were suspended at 0.5 metres depth from\
  \ floating docks in proximity to settlement plates deployed for a Bioblitz in the\
  \ fall of 2022, run by the Hakai Institute. The loggers were programmed to record\
  \ the water temperature at 10 minute intervals, starting at 12:00 on July 12th,\
  \ 2022 until removed from the water. Loggers were retrieved in early September,\
  \ 2022 and recordings beyond each retreival date are removed from the dataset. \n\
  \nThis data package includes: \n-Sea surface temperature data collected from loggers\
  \ in False Creek between July 12th and mid-September, 2022. \n-Site metadata, including\
  \ temperature logger location"
