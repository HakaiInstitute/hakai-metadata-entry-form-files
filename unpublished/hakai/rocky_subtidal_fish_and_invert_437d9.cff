abstract: "The rocky subtidal fish and invertebrate dataset is a component of Hakai\
  \ Institute\u2019s Nearshore research and monitoring program. This dataset characterizes\
  \ spatial and temporal trends in fish and invertebrates communities at 22 rocky\
  \ bottom subtidal sites near Calvert Island on the Central Coast of British Columbia\
  \ (2017-current). Data coverage varies by year and habitat type. Habitats include\
  \ unvegetated rocky reefs and kelp forests (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis\
  \ luetkeana) that were surveyed by SCUBA along 30 m transects. The total length\
  \ and abundance of all fish and large invertebrates excluding urchins were measured.\
  \ Seastar wasting disease was also recorded on surveys. This dataset characterizes\
  \ fish and invertebrate distributions and community-level relationships in rocky\
  \ subtidal nearshore areas representative of the British Columbia coast. \nThis\
  \ data package is freely available to everyone, following the principles of equitable\
  \ access and benefit sharing. However, we expect all data users to give attribution\
  \ to the data providers (read our data license) and the use of these data should\
  \ happen in the light of fair use, i.e.: 1) respect the data providers, and provide\
  \ helpful feedback on data quality, and 2) communicate and/or collaborate with the\
  \ providers if you are considering using this dataset for manuscripts or other forms\
  \ of reporting."
