abstract: "Carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) and total dissolved inorganic carbon\
  \ (TCO2) measurements were made on seawater collected from 12 depths at oceanographic\
  \ station QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia approximately every two weeks from\
  \ January 2016 to December 2023. These data were collected as part of the Hakai\
  \ Institute\u2019s objective to report on patterns of ocean acidification in coastal\
  \ British Columbia. Temperature, salinity, and pressure data were also captured\
  \ using CTD profilers (either Sea-Bird Electronics or RBR units following best practices)\
  \ at the time of seawater collection, and profile data was extracted for the depth\
  \ at which Niskin bottles were tripped. Sampling depth was determined by calibrated\
  \ line meter on the research vessel or RBR Solo pressure sensors attached to the\
  \ Niskin bottle. Samples were fixed at the time of collection using 80 \xB5l of\
  \ mercuric chloride aboard the Hakai Institute\u2019s research vessel. Temperature\
  \ and salinity were determined at the time of sample analysis at the Quadra Island\
  \ Field Station (QIFS) using NIST traceable thermometers (VWR PN 23609-176) and\
  \ a YSI MultiLab 4010-1 with a MultiLab IDS 4310 conductivity and temperature probe.\
  \ The YSI probe was calibrated using certified reference materials of known salinity\
  \ prior to seawater sample analysis. For detailed protocols on sample collection\
  \ and data processing, including CO2 system determination, please see Campbell et\
  \ al. (2023; http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.521066)."
