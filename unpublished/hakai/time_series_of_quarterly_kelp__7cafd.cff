abstract: "These data files represents a time series of surface kelp canopy area of\
  \ giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, and bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, derived\
  \ from atmospherically corrected Landsat imagery: Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM),\
  \ Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager\
  \ (OLI), and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager 2 satellite imagery. Observations\
  \ are made on a 16 day repeat cycle, for each instrument, but the temporal coverage\
  \ is irregular because of cloud cover, instrument failure, and the mission length\
  \ of each sensor (TM: 1984 \u2013 2011, ETM+: 1999 \u2013 present, OLI: 2013 \u2013\
  \ present). \n\nThe kelp canopy is composed of the portions of fronds and stipes\
  \ floating on the surface of the water. Nearshore (within one Landsat pixel, ~30m)\
  \ and low tide areas (both nearshore and offshore rocks) are masked during this\
  \ process, therefore kelp canopy area within those areas are excluded in this dataset.\
  \ See Bell et al. 2020 and 2023 for more details on methods. \n\nData are organized\
  \ into geotif files and contain the quarterly percent detections for each Landsat\
  \ pixel across the four sensors. For example, if there were 5 clear passes of a\
  \ pixel, and it was classified as kelp in 4 of them, then the pixel value is 80.\
  \ Kelp presence data are given for individual 30 x 30 meter pixels for coastal areas\
  \ the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. \n\nTemporal Coverage: begins 1984-04-01.\
  \ Dataset is ongoing.\n\nThese data are suitable for investigating kelp dynamics\
  \ at large spatial scales and consideration should be made in their use for any\
  \ given analysis. Local-scale analyses where species level data are needed, or where\
  \ kelp is fringing and sparse should use higher spatial resolution imagery for mapping\
  \ (e.g. fixed-wing surveys or drone surveys). For assistance with the data, please\
  \ contact data@hakai.org.\n\nFor detailed method refer to these articles:\n\nBell\
