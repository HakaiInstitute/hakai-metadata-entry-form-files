abstract: "The Airborne Coastal Observatory (ACO), developed by the Hakai Institute,\
  \ is an aerial remote sensing platform designed to map landscapes from icefields\
  \ to oceans. Using a Piper Navajo aircraft operated by Kisik Aerial Surveys (Delta,\
  \ BC), the ACO integrates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), high-resolution imagery,\
  \ and hyperspectral sensors to collect detailed environmental data in a single pass.\
  \ These tools are used to monitor changes in regional glaciers and snowpack, supported\
  \ by field observations and validated through ground-based sampling and sensor networks.\n\
  \nA primary focus of the ACO is to improve understanding of snow and glacier dynamics\
  \ across BC\u2019s mountainous coast. Long-term monitoring by the Hakai ACO captures\
  \ variations in snow inputs, which differ dramatically between rain-dominated and\
  \ snow-dominated zones. Snowpack is a critical factor in watershed modeling, helping\
  \ to explain variations in runoff and providing insights into how watersheds respond\
  \ to changing climate conditions. Coastal elevation gradients offer some resilience\
  \ in high-altitude watersheds, but the region remains particularly vulnerable due\
  \ to its comparatively mild winters.\n\nFor more information on post processing,\
  \ data quality assurance, software used, and summary of results please contact data@hakai.org"
