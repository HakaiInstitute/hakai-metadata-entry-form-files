abstract: "The Seagrass Fish & Macroinvertebrate dataset is a component of Hakai Institute\u2019\
  s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to determine the drivers of\
  \ change in seagrass ecosystems. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research\
  \ is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the\
  \ face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations.\n\
  \nThis data package contains fish and macroinvertebrate observations collected from\
  \ February 2019 to August 2021, at long-term seagrass meadow monitoring sites on\
  \ British Columbia\u2019s Central Coast. SCUBA divers collected data from 6 sites\
  \ annually and 2 sites seasonally along permanent 30m transects. Fish and macroinvertebrate\
  \ data were collected concurrently; 2 fish surveys were conducted alongside 2 macroinvertebrate\
  \ surveys (one for all macroinvertebrates and one for Cancer crabs and bivalve siphons\
  \ only). The data files included in this data package are: 1) \u2018Fish\u2019 surveys,\
  \ containing fish observations, and 2) \u2018Invertebrate\u2019 surveys, containing\
  \ macroinvertebrate observations. Species, abundance, and estimated size were recorded\
  \ for all observations. Data included here are a subset of the Hakai Institute\u2019\
  s seagrass monitoring dataset. \n\nThis Hakai data package is freely available to\
  \ everyone, following the principles of equitable access and benefit sharing. However,\
  \ creating data packages cannot happen without the contribution of many scientists\
  \ and data managers involved with science coordination, data aggregation, quality\
  \ control, and data management. Therefore, we expect all data users to give attribution\
  \ to the data providers (see README and LICENSE within package contents for further\
  \ details) and the use of data from Hakai Nearshore should happen in the light of\
  \ fair use, ie.:\n- Respect the data providers, and provide helpful feedback on\
  \ data quality\n- Communicate and/or collaborate with Hakai Nearshore researchers\
  \ if you are considering using this dataset for manuscripts, or other forms of reporting."
