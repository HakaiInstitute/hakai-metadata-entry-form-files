abstract: Tissue samples from particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, salmon
  and bycatch caught in the Northeast Pacific Ocean were analyzed for their fatty
  acid profiles. These data were collected as part of the International Year of the
  Salmon (IYS) Gulf of Alaska High Seas Expedition conducted in March-April 2020 to
  further improve the understanding of factors impacting salmon early marine winter
  survival. The fatty acid data provides information about trophic interactions in
  the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the health and condition of organisms.
