abstract: 'This dataset is a collection of all of the International Year of the Salmon
  High Seas Expeditions trawl catch, specimen measurements, zooplankton abundance,
  and CTD datasets that were collected at sea in 2019 aboard the Professor Kaganovsky,
  2020 on the Pacific Legacy NO.1, and 2022 aboard the CCGS Sir John Franklin, NOAA
  Bell M. Shimada, R/V TINRO, and R/V Northwest Explorer. These data span much of
  the North East Pacific Ocean and were collected to better our understanding of the
  ocean conditions salmon experience during winter and how that may drive high seas
  salmon survival.
