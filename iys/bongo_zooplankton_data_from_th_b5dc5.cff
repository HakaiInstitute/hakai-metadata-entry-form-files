abstract: This data set contains the zooplankton data collected using paired bongo
  tows from the R/V TINRO, NOAA Bell M. Shimada, F/V Northwest Explorer and R/V CCGS
  Sir John Franklin from February 5 - April 17, 2022 in the North Pacific Ocean. The
  paired bongo nets (60 cm in diameter, 253 micron mesh size) were deployed to a depth
  of approximately 250 m and retrieved vertically at 1 m s-1. Collected data are used
  to offer insights in zooplankton community composition, density and distribution.
  After the bongo net deployment and recovery, the net was rinsed down into the cod
  end. Volume of sea water filtered was determined using flowmeters. This dataset
  includes samples that were preserved in formalin. These samples were enumerated
  and identified to the lowest taxonomic rank possible or practical. Abundance (individuals
  per cubic meter) was recorded by species, lifestage, sex and size (range).
