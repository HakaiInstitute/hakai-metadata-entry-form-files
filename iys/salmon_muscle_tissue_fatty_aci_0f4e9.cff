abstract: "North Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) were caught by deploying trawl\
  \ nets between February 23 and March 16, 2022 during the winter expeditions of the\
  \ International Year of the Salmon to the North Pacific high seas onboard the R/V\
  \ CCGS Sir John Franklin. Trawl nets were deployed at each station in the top 50\
  \ meters of the water column and towed for 60 minutes (night) or 90 minutes (day)\
  \ at 4 to 5 knots. A 2x2 cm sample of salmon muscle tissue was collected from above\
  \ the lateral line and in front of the dorsal fin and stored at -80\xB0C. Muscle\
  \ samples were then processed in the laboratory at the University of British Columbia.\
  \ Tissue was lyophilized in freeze drier for 48 hours, homogenized using mortar\
  \ and pestle, encapsulated in tin (Sn) capsules, and sent for measurements of carbon\
  \ and nitrogen stable isotope ratios and elemental contents at an external lab.\
  \ Samples were analysed on an Elemental Analyser coupled to an Isotope Ratio Mass\
  \ Spectrometer. Details on analytical procedure are provided in the supplementary\
  \ materials 1 and 2. The data reported includes each sample \u1E9F13C, %C, \u1E9F\
  15N, % N, and CN ratios, in addition to the metadata associated with each sample\
  \ (e.g., coordinates of oceanographic station and bottom depth where salmon specimen\
  \ was collected, etc.)."
