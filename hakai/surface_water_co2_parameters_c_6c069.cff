abstract: "pCO2 and TCO2 measurements were made on surface seawater collected by tribal\
  \ citizens and non-oceanographic agencies around Kenai Peninsula in the northern\
  \ Gulf of Alaska from 2015 to 2017. Seawater was collected using bucket grabs or\
  \ Niskin bottles and drawn into 350 mL amber glass bottles. Sample bottles were\
  \ rinsed 3 times and then carefully filled with sample seawater as to not introduce\
  \ bubbles into the sample. Sample temperature was then recorded using NIST traceable\
  \ thermometers (VWR PN 23609-176) and fixed with 40 \xB5L of mercuric chloride before\
  \ being crimp-sealed using polyethylene-lined metal caps. Finally, temperature and\
  \ salinity were determined at the time of sample analysis at the Alutiiq Pride Shellfish\
  \ Hatchery (APSH) using NIST traceable thermometers and a YSI MultiLab 4010-1 with\
  \ a MultiLab IS 4310 conductivity and temperature probe. The YSI probe was calibrated\
  \ using certified reference materials of known salinity prior to seawater sample\
  \ analysis. For detailed protocols on sample collection, data processing including\
  \ CO2 system determination, and quality assurance, please see Pocock et al. (2017;\
  \ http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.521066). CO2 system parameters (pHT, pCO2, aragonite\
  \ saturation) were computed using the carbonate acid dissociation constants of Lueker\
  \ et al. (2000). Note alkalinity (Alk) is assumed to consist of carbonate, bicarbonate,\
  \ borate, hydroxide, and hydrogen ions; neglecting the influence of nutrients and\
  \ organic acids. The effort to collect these data are part of the Hakai Institute\u2019\
  s directive to advance the understanding of carbon cycling and coastal processes\
  \ around the Gulf of Alaska with specific emphasis on ocean acidification."
