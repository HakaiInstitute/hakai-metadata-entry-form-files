    <att name='title'>Hakai Bulk and Size-Fractionated Chlorophyll and Phaeopigment Concentrations Collected by Niskin Bottle, Provisional</att>
    <att name='summary'>This dataset is comprised of Hakai Institute chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations collected from 2014 to present at stations within the Calvert Island, Johnstone Strait, and the Quadra Island study regions. Samples for these data were collected in the field using Niskin bottles. Sample water (250 ml) was filtered through: 1) a single glass fiber filter (GF/F, nominal pore size 0.7 um) to comprise a bulk measure of phytoplankton chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations and 2) a stack of filters (GF/F, 3 um, and 20 um polycarbonate filters) to estimate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations from pico, nano, and micro-phytoplankton, respectively. Filters were extracted for 24 hours in 10 ml of 90% acetone and analyzed on Turner Designs Trilogy laboratory fluorometers using the acidification module and following the method of Holm Hansen et al. (1965). 

Data have been quality controlled by manual inspection which included a comparison of bulk concentrations against the sum of the size-fractionated filter concentrations. Where available, further comparisons were done with other measures of chlorophyll concentrations including in situ CTD chlorophyll fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data.

Data were collected by the Hakai Institute Oceanography and Nearshore programs.</att>

    <att name='comment'>##Limitations:
The utilized acidification method is sensitive to interference by high concentrations of chlorophyll c and b. High chlorophyll c concentrations can cause a slight overestimation of chlorophyll a and an underestimation of phaeopigments: negative phaeopigment concentrations can occur during bloom events with high chlorophyll c and healthy phytoplankton. High chlorophyll b concentrations can result in underestimations of chlorophyll a and overestimations of phaeopigments. When chlorophyll b is high relative to chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a can be underestimated by as much as 2.5 fold. For more details see Welschmeyer et al. (1994). These two types of interference likely had an influence on the published chlorophyll and phaeopigment dataset. Notably, comparison with HPLC has shown that stations in the Quadra Island region often experience conditions where chlorophyll b is present in high concentrations and is high relative to chlorophyll a.

The acidification method used to analyze the Hakai Institute dataset has been shown to highly overestimate phaeopigment concentrations based on comparison to concentrations determined by HPLC (Trees et al., 2003). Care should be used when interpreting the published phaeopigment concentrations. 

Prior to 2021, samples that exceeded the manufacturer specified instrument sensitivity range were not diluted to bring their concentrations within the specified range. Samples run above the instrument sensitivity range may have underestimated chlorophyll concentrations due to the blockage of light passing through the sample and a corresponding reduction of fluorescence output (see Turner Trilogy user manual for complete description). Comparison with matching HPLC derived chlorophyll a suggests that the affected samples may be useable, but further analysis is required. This provisional dataset includes these data.

Prior to 2018, annual calibrations of the Hakai Institute Turner Trilogy benchtop fluorometers showed variability in the calibration slopes and acid ratios that were applied to the data. The inconsistent nature of this variability suggests error due to analytical methods rather than instrument drift. As a result, the chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations of the data where these calibrations were applied may have error as high as +/- 12 % from this source alone. These data have been included in this provisional dataset. 

Prior to 2018, QA/QC analysis suggests potential influence by acid contamination on the chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations (i.e. very low chlorophyll a and high phaeopigment concentrations where the CTD fluorometer and HPLC showed high chlorophyll a). In 2018, methodological controls were put in place to limit acid contamination and the issue ceased. Care has been taken to flag the contaminated data, but data with less obvious contamination effects may not have been captured by QA/QC and may be present in this provisional dataset.

This provisional dataset includes all data flagged as "suspicious" (show suspicious trends, but may not be incorrect), but excludes data flagged as "discard" (clearly erroneous).</att>
