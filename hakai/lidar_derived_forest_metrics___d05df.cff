abstract: "72 LIDAR Derived Forest Metrics - Calvert Island - 20 Meter Spatial Resolution\n\
  \nLIDAR forest metrics have been developed for the Calvert Island region. The data\
  \ are in 20 meter resolution and detail a number of variables about the vegetation\
  \ layer above the bare earth model. Forest metrics have been grouped to show major\
  \ statistical themes such as gap fraction, stem height, and density. The information\
  \ is valuable for classifying forest structure and better understanding ecosystem\
  \ dynamics.\n\nLIDAR Forest Metrics Produced by GWF LiDAR Analytics\nA full list\
  \ of derived forest metrics produced by G.W. Frazer is listed at the end of this\
  \ abstract. \n\nLIDAR flights conducted in 2012 and 2014 covered all of Calvert\
  \ and Hecate Island. Flights were completed in August of 2012 (Terra Remote Sensing)\
  \ and August of 2014 (Brian Menounos UNBC).\n\nArea-based canopy height and density\
  \ metrics are derived directly from a height-normalized LAS point cloud using proprietary\
  \ software developed by G.W. Frazer (note: Fusion and LASTools are respectively\
  \ open-source and commercial software that can be used to extract various area-based\
  \ canopy metrics). These gridded products (approximately 55 bands) have a user-defined\
  \ 20 m spatial resolution and include (i) height-based statistics (e.g., min., max.,\
  \ mean, moments, percentiles), (ii) density-based statistics (i.e., gap fraction,\
  \ canopy cover at fractional and absolute heights above the ground surface), and\
  \ (iii) diagnostic information (e.g., number of laser points in each cell, number\
  \ of laser points classified as ground, number of points above a specific height\
  \ threshold, etc.). Area-based canopy metrics are used to characterize the three-dimensional\
  \ (3-D) structure of the vegetation canopies.\n\nList of LiDAR-Derived Canopy Height,\
