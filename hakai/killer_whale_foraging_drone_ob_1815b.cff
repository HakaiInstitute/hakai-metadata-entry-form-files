abstract: "The Hakai Institute's contribution to the project was to record feeding,\
  \ social interactions, and provide imagery for identifying and determining the size\
  \ of the killer whales being studied.\nThe killer whale study was conducted with\
  \ the partnership of University of British Columbia's Marine Mammal Research Unit.\
  \ UBC project leads were Sarah Fortune and Andrew Trites.\n\nPermit Information:\
  \ DFO and UBC animal care permit info (XMMS 6 2019 & A19-0053)\n\nResults and full\
  \ methodology documentation to be completed after the 2019 & 2020 field seasons.\n\
  \nResearch occurred aboard two vessels - the M/V Gikumi (18 m wooden, liveaboard\
  \ vessel) and the Steller Quest (6 m aluminium hull vessel). The M/V Gikumi was\
  \ used to collect hydroacoustic data, survey for marine mammals, conduct focal follows\
  \ and facilitate drone operations. The Steller Quest was principally used for the\
  \ deployment of suction-cup attached Customizable Animal Tracking Solutions tags\
  \ (CATs tags) and tracking tagged animals.  An overview map (Fig. 1) details the\
  \ route and areas of concentrated research activity. The main research goal was\
  \ to collect comparative information about the feeding behaviour of Southern and\
  \ Northern resident killer whales and the vertical distribution and abundance of\
  \ their prey (e.g., Chinook salmon).\n\nDatasets: 4k video, GPS track data, flight\
  \ laser altimeter data. Processed killer whale data are under review.\n\nOverview\
  \ of the research themes:\nFocal follows \nVisual observation of animals were made\
  \ from the vessel to continuously record their location and behaviour concurrent\
  \ with the collection of physical oceanographic data (salinity and temperature)\
  \ and prey data.\nHydroacoustics \nMulti-frequency echosounders were used to collect\
  \ fine-scale information about the vertical distribution and abundance of encountered\
  \ prey (e.g., Chinook, Sockeye, Coho). These data will be used to quantitatively\
  \ assess the quality and quantity of prey in Northern and Southern resident killer\
  \ whale habitat.\nBiologgers\nTo record underwater dive patterns and feeding behaviour\
  \ at depth using a biologer with a high-definition video camera, time-depth recorder,\
  \ accelerometer and magnetometer, fast acquisition GPS and hydrophone. The tag will\
  \ be used to kinematically and acoustically determine when and where whales capture\
  \ their prey and how successful they are at hunting. \nDrone imagery\nTo record\
  \ feeding, social interactions, and provide imagery for identifying and determining\
  \ the size of the killer whales being studied."
