    <att name='title'>Fucus Dynamics - Point Intercept Surveys - BC Central Coast - 2016-2019</att>
    <att name='summary'>The Fucus dynamics dataset is a component of the Hakai Instituteâ€™s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to capture change in rocky intertidal habitats. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. The dynamics of Fucus distichus beds were assessed from 2016-2019 at three coastal sites along the northwest edge of Calvert Island on the central coast of British Columbia. All three sites were exposed rocky shorelines with large beds of Fucus distichus algae. The structure and composition of the macroalgae & benthic invertebrate communities were surveyed in these beds using a point-intercept design within permanent plots. The sites were surveyed on an approximately monthly basis from May-September, with two winter surveys in November and February.
