abstract: "This dataset is comprised of Hakai Institute chlorophyll and phaeopigment\
  \ concentrations collected from 2014 to present at stations within the Calvert Island,\
  \ Johnstone Strait, and the Quadra Island study regions. Samples for these data\
  \ were collected in the field using Niskin bottles. Sample water (250 ml) was filtered\
  \ through: 1) a single glass fiber filter (GF/F, nominal pore size 0.7 um) to comprise\
  \ a bulk measure of phytoplankton chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations and\
  \ 2) a stack of filters (GF/F, 3 um, and 20 um polycarbonate filters) to estimate\
  \ chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations from pico, nano, and micro-phytoplankton,\
  \ respectively. Filters were extracted for 24 hours in 10 ml of 90% acetone and\
  \ analyzed on Turner Designs Trilogy laboratory fluorometers using the acidification\
  \ module and following the method of Holm Hansen et al. (1965). \n\nData have been\
  \ quality controlled by manual inspection which included a comparison of bulk concentrations\
  \ against the sum of the size-fractionated filter concentrations. Where available,\
  \ further comparisons were done with other measures of chlorophyll concentrations\
  \ including in situ CTD chlorophyll fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography\
  \ (HPLC) data.\n\nData were collected by the Hakai Institute Oceanography and Nearshore\
  \ programs."
