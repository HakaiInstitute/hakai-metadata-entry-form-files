abstract: "This is the metadata record for the LiDAR datasets acquired for Calvert\
  \ Island area, BC, Canada, in 2012 and 2014. It provides details on the two LiDAR\
  \ missions and the initial processing to merge the two datasets together. \n\nThe\
  \ dataset was created from two missions - one in 2012 and one in 2014. The two datasets\
  \ were merged together and used to generate numerous derived data products (see\
  \ the links section below). The 2012 mission collected hyperspectral and orthophotos\
  \ so the mission metadata for the LiDAR dataset also applies to those assets.  \
  \ \n\nTerrain elevations measured by airborne LiDAR were collected in August 2012\
  \ for Calvert Island, Hecate Island, and three other survey areas located to the\
  \ northeast (i.e., mouth of the Koeye River, port town of Namu, and the southwest\
  \ corner of King Island) by Terra Remote Sensing Inc. (TRSI), Sidney, BC (Figure\
  \ 1). The total aerial coverage of the acquisition was 477.2 km2. The point density\
  \ (number of returns per unit area) of the acquisition averaged approximately 2.34\
  \ pts/m2 for all posted returns (maximum of three discrete returns per pulse), 2.11\
  \ pts/m2 for first returns, and 0.51 pts/m2 for ground-classified returns. More\
  \ detailed information on the TRSI LiDAR sensor and survey settings, data pre-processing,\
  \ and quality checks and accuracy verification. A second airborne LiDAR data acquisition\
  \ was undertaken by the LiDAR Research Group, University of Northern BC (UNBC) in\
  \ August 2014, with the express purpose of collecting higher spatial resolution\
  \ (3.4\u201322.3 pts/m2) LiDAR data over selected research areas of interest on\
  \ Hecate and Calvert Islands, as well as to infill and eliminate several data voids\
  \ found in the initial TRSI LiDAR coverage.\n\n2012 Mission:\nDates: August 5th,\
  \ 15th ,and 17th\nConducted by: Terra Remote Sensing\nArea covered: 477.22 km^2\
  \ \nFlight height: 1150 meters above ground level \nProjection: UTM Zone 9\nDatum:\
  \ NAD 83\nGeoid: HT 2.0\nLiDAR points: a relative accuracy of +/-15 cm and absolute\
  \ accuracy of 1m \nHyperspectral Data: +/- 2 pixel\nPoint cloud density: Taking\
  \ random samples throughout the project area, the average point density for a single\
  \ flight line is 1pts/m2\n\n2014 Mission:\nDates: Aug. 7, 2014\nConducted by: UNBC\
  \ LiDAR Research Group\nArea Covered: 34.9 km^2\nFlight Height: ~475 m & 650 m +/-\
  \ 50m\nProjection: UTM Zone 9\nDatum: CSRS NAD 83\nGeoid: Ellipsoid heights\nPoint\
  \ density ranged from 22.3 pts/m2 to 3.4 pts/m2"
