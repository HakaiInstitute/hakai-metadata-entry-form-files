abstract: This dataset presents a collection of all the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
  (ADCP) instruments deployed by the Hakai Institute and the University of Victoria
  in the different study areas of the Hakai Institute near Calvert Island along the
  central coast of British Columbia and Quadra Island in Northern Strait of Georgia.
  Most of the data come from the coastal region around Calvert Island starting from
  February 2019. For all deployments, the instruments were deployed on a seabed bottom
  frame and lowered to the seabed in an upward-looking configuration. All instruments
  are RDI Workhorse instruments of different frequencies.
