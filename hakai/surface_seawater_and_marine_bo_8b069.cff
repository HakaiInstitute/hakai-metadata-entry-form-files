abstract: "Kwakshua Channel, located near Fitz Hugh Sound on the central coast of\
  \ British Columbia, has been a site for moored, high-resolution measurements of\
  \ surface seawater and marine boundary layer CO2 content since May 2018. Measurements\
  \ of in situ temperature, salinity, seawater and atmospheric CO2 partial pressure\
  \ are made using a Battelle Seaology (MApCO2) System. The effort to collect these\
  \ data are part of the Hakai Institute\u2019s directive to advance the understanding\
  \ of carbon cycling in northeast Pacific coastal settings with specific emphasis\
  \ on ocean acidification. This data contribution consists of measurements since\
  \ May 1, 2018."
