abstract: 'The QU5 mooring is a surface mooring deployed in a shallow coastal environment
  near the Hakai Institute Quadra Island station. The mooring is a test platform were
  low-cost oceanographic instrumentation is deployed at different depths to record
  sea water temperatures at an accuracy of 0.2 degrees Celsius. The temperature sensors
  are attached to an auxiliary line suspended from the surface buoy and along the
  main anchor line. Instruments are distributed tighter near the surface to better
  capture the higher vertical variability near the surface.


  This dataset present the provisional dataset which has been automatically QCed and
  flagged.'
