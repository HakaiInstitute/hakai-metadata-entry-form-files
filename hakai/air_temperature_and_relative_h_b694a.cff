abstract: "This data package consists of 5 years of quality controlled air temperature\
  \ and relative humidity data collected at 18 meteorological stations on Calvert\
  \ and Hecate Islands, 1 on the Koeye River, 1 on Ethel Island in Rivers Inlet, and\
  \ 1 on Quadra Island on British Columbia\u2019s coast. \nData is collected as part\
  \ of the Hakai climate and hydrometric observation network which is an ongoing monitoring\
  \ network that collects near-real time data providing many operational uses for\
  \ the general public and for marine and air traffic.\nTemporal coverage: September\
  \ 9th 2013 to October 1st 2019\nMethods for data quality control and assurance are\
  \ outlined in the companion document entitled \u201CObserved air temperature and\
  \ relative humidity from small coastal watersheds in British Columbia between 2013\
  \ and 2019.\u201D"
