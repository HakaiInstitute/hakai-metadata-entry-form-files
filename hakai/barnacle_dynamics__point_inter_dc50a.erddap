    <att name='title'>Barnacle Dynamics: Point Intercept Surveys - BC Central Coast - 2019</att>
    <att name='summary'>​The barnacle dynamics dataset is a component of the Hakai Institute’s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to capture change in rocky intertidal habitats. ​The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations.​ ​The barnacle community was assessed in 2019 at three coastal sites along the northwest edge of Calvert Island on the Central Coast of British Columbia. All three sites were exposed rocky shorelines with contiguous zones of substrate dominated by species of barnacle. The abundance and diversity of the barnacle species within these zones was surveyed using point-intercepts within permanent plots. The sites were surveyed on an approximately monthly basis from May-September, and two winter surveys in November and February.
