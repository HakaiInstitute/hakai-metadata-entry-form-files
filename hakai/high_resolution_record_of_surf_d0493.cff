abstract: "This dataset includes measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide\
  \ (pCO2), sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature and other parameters collected\
  \ in Sitka Harbor, Alaska, USA from 2017-06-01 to 2021-04-27. Sitka Tribe of Alaska\u2019\
  s Environmental Research Laboratory adjacent to Sitka Harbor, has been a site for\
  \ shore-based and high-resolution measurement of surface seawater CO2 content since\
  \ June 2017. Temperature, salinity, and CO2 partial pressure measurements are made\
  \ near-continuously from a seawater sample line with an intake 50 m from shore and\
  \ at a depth of 1 m in Sitka Harbor. The effort to collect these data is a collaboration\
  \ between the Sitka Tribe of Alaska and the Hakai Institute with support from the\
  \ Alaska Ocean Observing System."
