abstract: This dataset includes measurements of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide
  (pCO2), temperature, and salinity made on seawater drawn continuously from a 20-m
  intake at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in Bamfield, BC, Canada. The collection
  of these data utilizes a Burke-o-Lator (BoL) pCO2/TCO2 analyzer and began August
  30, 2023. The Burke-o-Lator (BoL) pCO2/TCO2 analyzer measures carbon dioxide partial
  pressure (pCO2) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) from a flow-through
  seawater stream and from seawater collected in discrete samples. The BoL is paired
  with a SBE 45 Thermosalinograph to measure seawater temperature and salinity. These
  data provide valuable information on patterns in marine carbonate chemistry and
  ocean acidification within Barkley Sound waters being supplied to the Bamfield Marine
  Sciences Centre and the Nova Harvest Ltd. shellfish hatchery.
