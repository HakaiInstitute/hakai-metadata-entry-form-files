abstract: "\u200BThe barnacle dynamics dataset is a component of the Hakai Institute\u2019\
  s Nearshore research and monitoring program, designed to capture change in rocky\
  \ intertidal habitats. \u200BThe overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research\
  \ is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the\
  \ face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations.\u200B\
  \ \u200BThe barnacle community was assessed in 2019 at three coastal sites along\
  \ the northwest edge of Calvert Island on the Central Coast of British Columbia.\
  \ All three sites were exposed rocky shorelines with contiguous zones of substrate\
  \ dominated by species of barnacle. The abundance and diversity of the barnacle\
  \ species within these zones was surveyed using point-intercepts within permanent\
  \ plots. The sites were surveyed on an approximately monthly basis from May-September,\
  \ and two winter surveys in November and February.\nThis data package is freely\
  \ available to everyone, following the principles of equitable access and benefit\
  \ sharing. However, we expect all data users to give attribution to the data providers\
  \ (read our data license) and the use of these data should happen in the light of\
  \ fair use, i.e.: 1) respect the data providers, and provide helpful feedback on\
  \ data quality, and 2) communicate and/or collaborate with the providers if you\
  \ are considering using this dataset for manuscripts or other forms of reporting."
