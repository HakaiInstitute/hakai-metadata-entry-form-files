abstract: This dataset present a time series of water level measurements made by an
  RBR Solo pressure sensor deployed by the Hakai Institute near the Calvert Island
  Research Station in the coastal region of Choke Pass. Sea Pressure collected by
  the instrument just above the sea bed was then corrected to substract the atmospheric
  pressure based on the Hakai Pruth Dock Weather Station. The resulting sea pressure
  was then converted to a depth with the Gibbs Sea Water TEOS-10 toolbox and substracted
  by the mean water level measured at the location.
