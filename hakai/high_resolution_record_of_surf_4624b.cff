abstract: "Sitka Tribe of Alaska\u2019s Environmental Research Laboratory adjacent\
  \ to Sitka Harbor, has been a site for shore-based and high-resolution measurement\
  \ of surface seawater CO2 content since June 2017. Measurements of in situ temperature,\
  \ salinity, and CO2 partial pressure are made near-continuously from a seawater\
  \ sample line with an intake 50 m from shore and at a depth of 1 m in Sitka Harbor.\
  \ The effort to collect these data is a collaboration between the Sitka Tribe of\
  \ Alaska and the Hakai Institute with support from the Alaska Ocean Observing System.\
  \ The collection and analysis of these data are part of the Hakai Institute\u2019\
  s directive to advance the understanding of carbon cycling in northeast Pacific\
  \ coastal settings with specific emphasis on sea-air CO2 exchange and ocean acidification.\
  \ This data contribution consists of measurements from June 1, 2017 to October 30,\
  \ 2017."
